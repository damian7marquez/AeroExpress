This is going to be where the frontend goes (AKA david & brian's stuff)!

This is a Vue app, so to run this on your machine, make sure you have Node.js, Vue, Vite, and Yarn installed.

To install node.js:


To install yarn:
1. open command prompt on your computer
2. run npm install --global yarn
instructions here:
https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#windows-stable

To install vite & vue:
1. open terminal in vscode 
2. cd into whatever folder you have the website files in on your computer (in this case probably Desktop/Aero/aeroexpress)
3. run yarn
4. run yarn dev

should automatically create a vite + vue app for you (vue = another version of react)
