This is going to be where the frontend goes (AKA david & brian's stuff)!

This is a Vue app, so to run this on your machine, make sure you have Node.js, Vue, Vite, and Yarn installed.

To install node.js:


To install yarn:
1. open command prompt on your computer
2. run npm install --global yarn
instructions here:
https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#windows-stable

To install vite & vue:
1. open terminal in vscode 
2. cd into whatever folder you have the website files in on your computer (in this case probably Desktop/Aero/aeroexpress)
3. run yarn
4. run yarn dev

should automatically create a vite + vue app for you (vue = another version of react)

There are 2 files in this folder- login.html (for Brian) and signup.html (for David)
If you guys can try and turn these two files specifically into login and signup pages for our website-
each page will be its own .html page inside of our client (frontend) folder
I can make them functional in backend later, but getting frontend running would be helpful

here is a helpful tutorial about using Vue (frontend development is the first 30 mins)
